"""
Define a function max() that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Use the if-then-else construct available in Python. (It is true that Python has the max() function built in, but writing it yourself is nevertheless a good exercise.)

def max(a, b):
    if a > b:
        return a
    else:
        return b
        
print max(5,8)
